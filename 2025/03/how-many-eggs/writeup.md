## Slide 2

What is an egg?

1. Birds like hens release eggs from their ovaries like human females (ovulation). 
2. Some eggs may be fertilised by a sperm. 
3. Hen ejects the released egg through her vagina (egg laying). 
4. She keeps laying eggs over a period of weeks until the clutch size is reached. 
5. She broods over the clutch to help the eggs hatch.

How has this been possible? Swipe to find out..
Picture: Increase in number of eggs laid by naturally occurring red jungle fouls many centuries ago through hens in 1900s and in present time.

## Slide 4

Humans have caused this exponential increase in the number of eggs a hen lays through a combination of:
1. **Artificial selection or selective breeding**
_Deliberately choosing hens and roosters with high egg yield, trapping future generations in a cycle of unnatural overproduction._
2. **Not letting the clutch reach its size**
_Continuous removal of eggs laid by the hen to fool her into thinking that the clutch size has not been reached, causing distress._
3. **Starvation**
_When the henâ€™s egg production starts to drop, her system is shocked into laying more eggs by starving her for two weeks._
4. **Shock lighting**

Does this take a toll on the hens?

## Slide 5

**Uterine prolapse**
_Excessive egg laying causes her uterus to weaken, similar to human uterine prolapse_

**Egg binding**
_Egg gets lodged in the reproductive tract causing severe infection_

**Psychological distress**
_Obviously!_ (this is only here because I wasn't sure what to add beneath this text)

Q: What is the key reason for this?

A: Seeing hens as egg vending machines for humans. 
     

Q: How many eggs does a hen lay _for us_ in a year?

A: ZERO!  Because her body and her eggs are **NOT FOR US**.
